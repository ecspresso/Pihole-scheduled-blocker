## How to
1. Copy `script.sh` to `/home/pi/script.sh`.
2. Edit the script and replace with any domain you want to block. These go under the variable `list`.
3. Schedule the script in cron. See `crontab example.sh` for an example.

## Commands
`script.sh block` to add to the blacklist and `script.sh unblock` to remove.
